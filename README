Mirror is a configurable PingPong IO bot. It can be configured in its configuration file to interpret specific input.

    hey|hi_hello
This above line in the configuration file will cause the bot to return "hello" when you tell it either "hey" or "hi".

The barebones configuration file is:
	file:filename
	input:>
	learn:$
